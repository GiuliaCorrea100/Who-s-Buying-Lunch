# Who-s-Buying-Lunch
This repository includes two JavaScript projects. The first is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator created with raw JavaScript. The second project uses Math.random() and arrays to randomly select a person from a list who will pay for lunch. The code were tested using the Chrome Web Developer Tools.
